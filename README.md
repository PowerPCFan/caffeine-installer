# Caffeine Installer

# Options
### Option 1: Premade file
1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/caffeine-installer/releases/latest) and download CaffeineInstaller.exe.
2. Run the installer, select the options you want, and press Install - that's it!

### Option 2: Build from source
(For advanced users only) Clone the GitHub repo, make sure all the necessary prerequisites are installed (make venv with `python -m venv venv`, activate venv, then install with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`), and then run `build.ps1` in PowerShell (`.\build.ps1`). Your compiled `.exe` will be in `/dist`.
